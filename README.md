## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned how to use Semantics element in HTML. 
I also learnt CSS flex property, media queries, min and max values, etc.
I learnt the use of GIT version control system and markdown.


### Continued development

I will like to improve on my use of semantic element in HTML and use of CSS properties like flex_box, grid_systems, media_queries and so on.
